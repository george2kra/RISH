# R.I.S.H.
## Rental Item Services for the Household
RISh is an ITEM sharing app, a platform that connects people looking for a household service with other people that have that service for sharing.

RISH is a community based web strategy enabling locals to show case what items they are willing to share with others to use and return in good order for a short time.  

Rishâ€™s welcoming dashboard is intuative allowing owners to sign in and maintain their ads, RISH also provides an asset management tool allowing them to see how many times their items have been shared. Potential borrowers can freely peruse whats available before they need to signup.

Rish provides a wide range of sharing services such as car sharing, caravan, trailer, lawn mower, home garage parking, shed space, book sharing, house kitchens, food processors, vacuum cleaners, practically anything that people are willing to share. Image downloads are managed using carrierwave

Once you have identified the resources, Rish will visually display nearest services in locale by using a pin on a map to maximise the user experience. Rish will connect you to the owners to allow interaction with one another to confirm transaction.

All online payment processes are done via a credit card using Stripe. Stripe is world wide company for small businesses to handle their internet payment in a safe and easy manner. All transactions are uniquely identified using token IDâ€™s and no crirical financial information is not shared.
